How to use the program?

First:
Compile the program using this command:
g++ Huffman.cpp CodeTable.cpp -o ex

Second:
Run the executable file to compress input.txt into output.txt
./ex input.txt output.txt c

Third:
Run the executable file to decompress output.txt into decomp.txt

Fourth:
flag can be 'c' in case of compressing or 'd' in case of decompressing 

*************************************************************************
Note: 
Using different compiler may result in different result. We did run the 
program on linux virtual machine using g++ compiler, and it works just fine. 
If you have any thing different on your side, please let us prepare a zoom 
meeting in which we can share screen and let you see it working as expected.
